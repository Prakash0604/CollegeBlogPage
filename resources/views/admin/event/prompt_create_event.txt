### Event Module Requirements and Summary:

The **Event Module** is designed to create and manage events, including the ability to select individual dates or a range of dates for event scheduling. Here's a summary of what we've done and achieved:

---

#### **1. Event Creation Form:**
   - **Requirements**: We created a form for event creation with the following fields:
     - **Event Name**: Required text input field.
     - **Description**: Required text area for event details.
     - **Date Selection**: Option to choose between a **date range** or **individual dates**.
     - **Date Range Selection**: When selected, users can input a start and end date for the event.
     - **Individual Dates Selection**: Users can manually add specific dates.
     - **Save Button**: Submits the form.

   - **Achieved**: The form is set up to handle the above requirements, allowing the user to select either a date range or individual dates. The dates are then displayed dynamically.

---

#### **2. Toggle Date Selection:**
   - **Requirements**: The user should be able to choose between selecting a **date range** or **individual dates**.
   - **Achieved**:
     - Implemented radio buttons to toggle between selecting a date range or individual dates.
     - Based on the selection, corresponding sections are shown or hidden (using `d-none` class for visibility control).

---

#### **3. Date Range Handling:**
   - **Requirements**: When a date range is selected, the start and end dates should generate a list of dates in between.
   - **Achieved**:
     - When the user clicks "Apply Range," the system calculates the range of dates and displays them.
     - The dates are stored in an array and displayed dynamically, allowing for easy management.

---

#### **4. Individual Date Selection:**
   - **Requirements**: Allow users to manually add individual event dates.
   - **Achieved**:
     - A button is provided to allow users to add individual dates, which are displayed dynamically as the user selects them.

---

#### **5. Schedule Management:**
   - **Requirements**: Each selected date (either from the range or individual) should have an option to manage the schedule for that date.
     - Manage start time, end time, description, and apply the schedule to all selected dates if needed.
   - **Achieved**:
     - The **"Manage Schedule"** button is linked to each selected date.
     - A modal is shown when clicking "Manage Schedule" that allows setting the schedule (start time, end time, and description).
     - Option to **apply the schedule to all selected dates** via a checkbox.
     - The schedule is added dynamically to a list of schedules for the event.

---

#### **6. Saving and Viewing the Schedule:**
   - **Requirements**: Save the schedule details and display them.
   - **Achieved**:
     - The **Save Schedule** button captures the entered details (start time, end time, description) and adds them to a schedule list.
     - The schedule lis t is displayed under the event, and users can see the scheduled times and descriptions for each date.
     - **View and Remove Schedule** options are provided in the list, allowing users to view or delete any schedule.

### **Summary of Achievements:**
1. **Event Creation**: A functional form that supports creating an event with date range and individual date options.
2. **Date Handling**: The ability to handle and display a range of dates or individual dates for the event.
3. **Schedule Management**: Integration of a modal for managing event schedules with flexible date application options.
4. **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time updating of selected dates and schedules, making the module interactive and user-friendly.
5. **Modal Integration**: Properly integrated modal windows for managing event schedules, with validations to ensure required fields are filled out before saving.

The event module is now capable of creating events, selecting dates, and managing schedules dynamically, meeting the core requirements for event scheduling.
