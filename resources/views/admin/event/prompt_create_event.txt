Here's a summary of what has been done and the new updates:

    Event Creation Form:
        Created a form for event creation, allowing users to enter event name, description, and select dates.
        Added a toggle to switch between selecting a date range and individual dates.

    Date Selection:
        Implemented a date range selection (start_date and end_date) or individual date selection via dynamically generated date input fields.
        Added functionality to add multiple individual dates and manage their schedules.

    Schedule Management:
        A modal popup was created for managing time slots for events. Users can specify a start and end time for each date, and these times are validated to ensure they are in the correct order.
        Once a valid time slot is added, itâ€™s displayed in a list under the modal.
        Users can remove time slots if needed.

    Validation:
        Implemented validation to ensure that a time slot has a valid range (end time after start time).
        Added functionality to ensure time slots do not overlap for a given date by checking against the last scheduled time for that date.

    Dynamic Date Input:
        When adding individual dates, the system dynamically generates a date input and a button for managing its schedule.
        Each date input has a button to manage time slots for that specific date.

    New Updates:
        Fixed the issue where the date popup (calendar selection) was being triggered unnecessarily.
        Corrected the issue where removed time slots would not update or be cleared from the list properly.
